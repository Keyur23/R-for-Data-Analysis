# Data Analysis with R üöÄ

Welcome to my **R Data Analysis Projects** repository! This collection showcases my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using R. The projects demonstrate how to extract insights from raw data, clean it for analysis, and visualize key trends and patterns.

---

## What's Inside:
- üßπ **Data Cleaning**: Explore how data is preprocessed and cleaned using R for accurate analysis.
- üìä **Data Visualization**: Discover visualizations created using **ggplot2**, **plotly**, and base R to highlight data insights.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Data Analysis**: Learn how to perform advanced analysis with R to derive conclusions from complex datasets.

## Project Highlights:

### 1. EV Population Data Analysis üìä
- This R project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) population data to uncover key trends and insights. It cleans and preprocesses the dataset, removing duplicates, renaming columns, and handling missing values. Summary statistics are generated, including average electric range, MSRP, and total vehicle counts by state. The project also features compelling visualizations, such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and boxplots, created with ggplot2 to highlight EV distributions, state-wise counts, and the relationship between range and price. Designed for exploratory data analysis, it provides a comprehensive overview of EV market trends.

## How to Use:
1. **Explore**: Dive into R scripts or R Markdown files within the repository to see the analysis in action.
2. **Review Data**: Download datasets from the **data/** directory to view how the raw data is transformed for analysis.
3. **Visualizations**: View a variety of plots, including line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive plots.

## Technologies Used:
- **R**: The primary language for data analysis.
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization and plotting.
- **dplyr**: Data manipulation.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data science.
- **lubridate**: Working with date and time data in R.
- **RMarkdown**: Interactive documents for combining code and analysis.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/r-data-analysis-projects.git
    ```
2. Install the necessary R packages (if not already installed):
    ```R
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "plotly"))
    ```
3. Open the R scripts or RMarkdown files in **RStudio** to explore the analysis.
4. Run the scripts to interact with the data and see the analyses in action.
