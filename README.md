# Data Analysis with R 🚀

Welcome to my **R Data Analysis Projects** repository! This collection showcases my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using R. The projects demonstrate how to extract insights from raw data, clean it for analysis, and visualize key trends and patterns.

---

## What's Inside:
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Explore how data is preprocessed and cleaned using R for accurate analysis.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Discover visualizations created using **ggplot2**, **plotly**, and base R to highlight data insights.
- ⚙️ **Data Analysis**: Learn how to perform advanced analysis with R to derive conclusions from complex datasets.

## Project Highlights:

### 1. EV Population Data Analysis 📊
- This R project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) population data to uncover key trends and insights. It cleans and preprocesses the dataset, removing duplicates, renaming columns, and handling missing values. Summary statistics are generated, including average electric range, MSRP, and total vehicle counts by state. The project also features compelling visualizations, such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and boxplots, created with ggplot2 to highlight EV distributions, state-wise counts, and the relationship between range and price. Designed for exploratory data analysis, it provides a comprehensive overview of EV market trends.

### 2. King County House Price Analysis 📈
- This R project analyzes house sales data from King County, USA, to uncover key factors influencing property prices and build predictive insights. It cleans and preprocesses the dataset, removing unnecessary columns, handling outliers, and filtering extreme values. Summary statistics are generated, including average house prices, square footage, and bedroom/bathroom counts. The project features compelling visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and comparison charts, created with ggplot2 to highlight price distributions, the relationship between living space and price, and actual vs. predicted price trends. Designed for exploratory data analysis, it provides a comprehensive overview of the King County real estate market and includes a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

### 3. Fitness Analysis 💪📊
- This R project analyzes fitness tracker data to uncover key factors influencing physical activity, sleep patterns, and calorie expenditure. Using data from Fitbit users, it cleans and preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting date-time formats. The project generates summary statistics, including average daily steps, sleep duration, and heart rate trends.

### 4. Uber Data Analysis 🚗📊
- This R project analyzes Uber ride data from New York City (April-September 2014) to uncover key trends and patterns in ride-hailing behavior. It processes and combines 6 months of ride data, extracting temporal features like hour, day, month, and day of week. The project features compelling visualizations including bar charts, heat maps, and geographic maps of NYC based on pickup locations, created with ggplot2 and ggthemes. It reveals insights about peak ride hours, popular days, and seasonal variations in ride patterns, providing a comprehensive overview of Uber's ride-sharing patterns in NYC.

## How to Use:
1. **Explore**: Dive into R scripts or R Markdown files within the repository to see the analysis in action.
2. **Review Data**: Download datasets from the directory to view how the raw data is transformed for analysis.
3. **Visualizations**: View a variety of plots, including line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive plots.

## Technologies Used:
- **R**: The primary language for data analysis.
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization and plotting.
- **dplyr**: Data manipulation.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data science.
- **lubridate**: Working with date and time data in R.
- **RMarkdown**: Interactive documents for combining code and analysis.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/r-data-analysis-projects.git
    ```
2. Install the necessary R packages (if not already installed):
    ```R
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "plotly"))
    ```
3. Open the R scripts or RMarkdown files in **RStudio** to explore the analysis.
4. Run the scripts to interact with the data and see the analyses in action.
